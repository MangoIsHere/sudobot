##### Breaking Changes!!!
Some commands will now require specific permissions. Users without those permissions will not be able to run those commands.
The required permissions are given below:

Command                       |Permission(s)
------------------------------|-------------
Ban                           |`BAN_MEMBERS`
Kick                          |`KICK_MEMBERS`
Mute                          |`MODERATE_MEMBERS` (Timeout Members)
Clearing messages             |`MANAGE_MESSAGES`
Setting Channel Permissions   |`MANAGE_CHANNELS`

Users having the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission will be able to bypass these requirements. Commands not listed here are not affected in this change.
